			<div><p>I was featured in <a href ="http://www.fosters.com/news/20180112/garrison-school-4th-graders-get-hands-on-coding-experience">Fosters</a> newspaper for volunteering to teach fourth graders the basics of coding
			This was part of Great Bay Community Colleges ongoing efforts and opportunities to teach the Garrison Elementary School fourth grade class about coding. I volunteered many hours of my time, as well as I created a basic game in Greenfoot for them to complete and learn to finish coding on.</p></div>

            <div><p>This is my first large project and what is ultimately helped me decide that this is what I wanted to do for a career. Thievo was a project I worked on in conjuntion with my brother. It was an exploration of app development and networking. Our goal was to see if we could scrape the internet for information regarding television shows to automatically update you when a new episode has been released. Source not provided.</p></div>

			<div><p>This ePortfolio itself. Work on this ePortfolio started over two years ago, before I had any formal instruction on coding and programming. Since then I've delved into programming languages and project management. Since this project is now on Github it was a good way to better learn version control through git. Coming back to this ePortfolio for graduation was a good way to look back on previous mistakes and a good first step to learning how to handle legacy code.</p></div>
