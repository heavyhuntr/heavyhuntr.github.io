              <h2>Origin</h2>
			  <p>My name is Taylor Forest Bent. I was born, raised, and still reside in Dover, NH, USA. I am currently 24 years old. I dropped out of high school early and went on to achieve my GED diploma. After this point I worked a few odd jobs while trying to find what I truly wanted to do. Between experimenting with code and a nudge from my brother I was able to decide: software development. In Fall of 2015 I enrolled and tested into <a href="http://greatbay.edu">Great Bay Community College</a> in the Computer Technologies field.</p>
              <h2>Goals</h2>
			  <p>I have two side projects; one of creating a better Dungeons and Dragons utility that one day I would like to see published and the other is a mobile app to help share, manage, and keep business cards.</p>
			  <h2>School</h2>
			  <p>I have now graduated from <a href="http://greatbay.edu">Great Bay Community College</a>, with an Associates Degree in Computer Technologies.</p>
			  <p>While at Great Bay a programming club was formed in the 2016-2017 school year, and I knew I had to join. Upon the end of that school year there was a vote and I was the 2017-2018 programming club president.</p>
              <h2>Hobbies</h2>
              <p>I have been active within select gaming communities and have been known to help other upcoming players in their games. I also spend some of my spare time learning coding languages and making programs and projects for my own desires. The languages I am familiar with include: HTML, Java, C++, and Python.</p>
              <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
              <p>I am detail oriented and have a penchant for testing things until they break. I am also very passionate and determined about my various interests. I play and lead Dungeons and Dragons regularly with my friends. My summers as a youth were spent at summer camp and in turn I took to being a volunteer camp counselor to help pass on the camping spirit and experiences.</p>
