              <h2>Origin</h2>
              <p>My name is Taylor Forest Bent. I was born, raised, and still reside in Dover, NH, USA. I am currently 22 years old.</p>
              <h2>Goals</h2>
              <p>I am graduating from <a href="http://greatbay.edu">Great Bay Community College</a>, with an Associates Degree in Computer Technologies in Spring of 2018. I enrolled in and started my college education with this institution in Fall of 2015. Now I am focused on joining the workforce as a Quality Assurance Analyst.</p>
              <h2>Hobbies</h2>
              <p>I have been active within select gaming communities and have been known to help other upcoming players in their games. I also spend some of my spare time learning coding languages and making programs and projects for my own desires. The languages I am familiar with include: HTML, Java, C++, and Python.</p>
              <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
              <p>I am detail oriented and have a penchant for testing things until they break. I am also very passionate and determined about my various interests. I play and lead Dungeons and Dragons regularly with my friends. My summers as a youth were spent at summer camp and in turn I took to being a volunteer camp counselor to help pass on the camping spirit and experiences.</p>
